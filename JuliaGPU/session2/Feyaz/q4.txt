The first method of defining "A" makes "A" a 3x2 array. It is then possible to take the sqare root of every term, because each element of A is effectively an Int. Then the int values are stored in the same format as "A". But since the elements of "A" are Int, sorting each element doesn't work, because the sort funnction isn't defined for a single int/
The second method of defining "A" makes "A" a 3 element array, whose each element is a two element array. The sort function is defined for each element of "A", as it is an array. But the sqrt of each element of A cannot be found, because square root isn't defined for an array.
