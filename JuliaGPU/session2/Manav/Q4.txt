When a=[[2 1];[4 3];[6 5]], sqrt.(a) works and gives the individual square roots of each number as theyre individual elements of 
the array however sort.(a) as individually sorting an element doesnt make sense!
When a=[[2 1],[4 3],[6 5]], sqrt.(a) doesnt work because an element here is another array whose square root cannot be found out,
however sort.(a) works because now an element here reprents the elements within an array which can be sorted!
